# Dansei Sotsuko
a minecraft visual novel game

## What the hell is Dansei Sotsuko?
Dansei Sotsuko is a project I originally started for school and then
advanced by my own interest. It's a visual novel, but instead of
a typical anime high school or slice of life story,
this is be about minecraft. 

## How do I play the game?
At the moment, you can't play the game the way I planned it. 
After all of the development is done, I want to pack it into an electron application and then
build it as an executable.

## Credits
Thanks to these people:

- Maxi [RyanFLM] (Brought me to the idea of using local storage instead of json files)
- Zek [Zekromizer] (Wrote the basic story idea)
